This is our project! To look at the website then look under Environments then click github-pages. Next, click the top deployment.Thanks so much!

If you want to take a look at the code, then click index.html to start.
The file index.html is the skeleton of our home page. I you would like to look at the css fille associated with the home page, then click style.css.
The file experiencepage.html is the skeleton of our page called Experience. The css file that is associated with experiencepage.html is called styles.css.

I hope that you enjoy our project!
