    <h2>About Us</h2>
     <p>As music students in this virtual age, we have struggled to find proper substitutes to learn and practice music. When it comes to music education, itâ€™s best to practice and perform in a physical setting. With choir, for example, physical classroom experience allows students to have the opportunity to be able to hear all of the different voice parts of their fellow classmates. They can also hear how these parts come together in real-time. Currently, with platforms like Zoom and Google Meetings, students cannot sing together with their respective parts in harmony. So we asked ourselves a few questions. 
      <p></p>
      <p> 1) "What is the ideal music classroom setting?"</p>
<p> 2) "What aspects of music-based learning are most instrumental in maximizing a student's performance?"</p>
<p>3)  "How do we offer music students a more interactive and engaging experience?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="Mission">
      <h3>Mission</h3>
      Our aim is to create a virtual space for music students to listen and practice music in an interactive setting.</p>
       
    </div>
    
    <div class="Vision">
      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>We want to create a musical space where all students and non-students alike, with all music learning styles, can come together and learn in a virtual setting.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <details>
        <summary>What's next?</summary>
        <p>With more time, the user would be able to turn towards a certain musical part and the audio would for that specific section would increase. We also have plans to make uploading different pieces and songs for the participants to listen to much easier.</p>
