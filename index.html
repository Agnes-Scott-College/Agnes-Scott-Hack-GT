    <h2>About Us</h2>
     <p>As music students in this virtual age, we struggled to find proper substitutes for more engaging and interactive musical settings. When it comes to music education, optimal performance is achieved in a physical setting best. With a physical classroom experiene,students have the privellege of being able to hear all of the different voice types of their fellow classmates, how they come together, and in real time. Currently, with platforms like Zoom and Google Meetings, students cannot sing together with their respective parts in harmony. So we asked ourselves a few questions:"What is the ideal music classroom setting?" "What aspects in a music learning are most instrumental in maximizing a student's performance?"and "How do we offer music students a more interactive and engaging experience?"</p>

    <div class="Mission">
      <h3>Mission</h3>

    </div>
    
    <div class="Vision">
      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p> We would like to create a musical space where all students and non-students alike, with all music learning styles are able to come together and learn in a virtual setting</p>

      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <details>
        <summary>What's next?</summary>
        <p>With more time, the user would be able to turn towards a certain musical part and the audio would for that specific section would increase. We also have plans to make uploading different pieces and songs for the participants to listen to much easier.</p>
