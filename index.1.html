      <p>
        In a virtual age, music students are having trouble finding a proper substitute for learning music together. When music is learned in a group setting physically, you have the opportunity to hear the different parts and see how each part interacts and relate to others. Currently, with platforms like Zoom and Google Meetings, students cannot sing together with their respective parts. Our aim is to create a virtual space for music students that not only allows you to be able to interact with the music but to be able to here the different parts of the music.</p>
